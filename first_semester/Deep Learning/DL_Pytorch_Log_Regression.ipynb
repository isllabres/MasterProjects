Namely, in our programs we will define functions $f_{\\mathbf{w}}(x)$ of given input data $x$ and some parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ to be optimized, and we will use Pytorch's [autograd package](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html) to automatically compute $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{w}} f_{\\mathbf{w}}(x)$, and then use the gradient into a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) routine.\n","\n","But lets go step by step. First of all, we will load some database and perform some pre-processing. To do so, we will use the **[Python Data Analysis Library](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** (a.k.a. pandas).

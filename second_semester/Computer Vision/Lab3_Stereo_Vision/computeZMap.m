% Function that computes a Depth Map from a pair of images 
% Sintaxis: computeZMap(imageName,f,B,Ws,win_size)
% Inputs:
%       imageName: Name of the image pair (without extensiÃ³n)
%       f: Flocal Length (mm)
%       B: Baseline between cameras (cm)
%       Ws: Sensor Width (mm)
%       win_size: window size for the matching algorithm

%Relate sensor and image by computing the pixel width (in mm/px)
pxWidth = Ws/size(imL, 2);

%Transform the Disparity matrix from pixels to mm

%Compute the depth of the points in meters
Z = ((10*f*B)./D)/1000

%We limit Z values to improve visualization
